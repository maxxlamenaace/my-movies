## :post_office: Code repository

### :rocket: Commit

Some pre-commit hooks made with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) are listening to commit events. To enable them you must run

```shell
npm install -g commitizen
npm run prepare
```

Then, when you are ready to commit, just run this command

```shell
git commit -m "your commit message"
```

You will see that hooks are going to be triggered and will do the following

- Lint code and check its quality
- Format your commit message using [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli). You just have to follow the different steps.

Then when everything is correct, push your changes to the repo

```shell
git push origin <your-branch>
```
